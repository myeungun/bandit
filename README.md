1. ETC_UCB_EXP3_EXP3-IX.py
- Simulate four algorithms (ETC, UCB, EXP3, EXP3-IX) in a Gaussian stochastic bandit environment with 10 arms. The mean of each arm was chosen uniformly at random in (0, 1), and the variance is fixed at 1.

2. UCB_KL-UCB.py
- Performance comparison between UCB and KL-UCB.

3. ETC_EXP3_EXP3-IX_adversarial.py
- Changes in ETC policy results according to the number of exploration times of each arm (m).
- Performance analysis of EXP3 and EXP3-IX under adversarial bandits.
